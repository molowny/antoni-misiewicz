  about:
    lead: "Hi! I'm Anthony Misiewicz. I was born on 4 July 2011 in Suwalki. Previous months I spent in my mummy’s tummy with my twin sister Olena. After birth, we had to say goodbye - I had to stay in the hospital because I had trouble with breathing. Doctors put additional diagnosis - <strong>Down syndrome.</strong>"
    paragraph_1: "To confirm the diagnosis, parents had to wait a bit. When I and Olena finished month, Mom and Dad took us to Warsaw, where we live. At that time genetic research confirmed the diagnosis of doctors. After that I began visiting various specialists:"
    paragraph_2: "In addition to the systematic doctors’ observation I am also under the care of other specialists: physiotherapists and pedagogue of mentally disabled. I am attending  physical rehabilitation three times a week, and my mom works with me at home. I meet pedagogue of mentally disabled every 2-3 weeks, and then practice with my parents."
    paragraph_3: "Progress that gives rehabilitation is visible with the naked eye. I will update the page regularly, so I hope you will notice them too :)"
